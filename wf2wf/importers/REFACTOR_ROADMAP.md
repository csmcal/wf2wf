### ⚠️ Partially Compliant Importers

#### Snakemake Importer (65/100) - **NEEDS FURTHER REFACTORING**
- **Strengths:**
  - Inherits from `BaseImporter`
  - Uses shared infrastructure for inference and loss integration
  - Good use of shared interactive prompting
- **Critical Issues:**
  - ❌ **OVERRIDES `import_workflow()`** - Violates specification
  - ❌ **Large codebase** - 1,415 lines (should be under 800)
  - ❌ **Duplicates some shared logic**
- **Action Required:** Remove `import_workflow()` override, reduce code size

### ❌ Unrefactored Importers

#### Nextflow Importer (0/100)
- **Current State:** Traditional DSL2 parsing with custom workflow
- **Estimated Refactor Effort:** 4-6 hours
- **Target Code Size:** 600-700 lines
- **Priority:** High (complex format, widely used)

#### WDL Importer (0/100)
- **Current State:** Workflow parsing with custom implementation
- **Estimated Refactor Effort:** 3-4 hours
- **Target Code Size:** 400-500 lines
- **Priority:** Medium

#### Galaxy Importer (0/100)
- **Current State:** Galaxy workflow format parsing
- **Estimated Refactor Effort:** 2-3 hours
- **Target Code Size:** 300-400 lines
- **Priority:** Low

## Immediate Action Items

### 1. ✅ CWL Importer Enhancement (COMPLETED)
**Status:** Successfully enhanced CWL importer with:
- Resource processor integration
- Execution model inference
- Enhanced shared infrastructure usage
- Improved compliance score from 85/100 to 95/100
- All tests passing

### 2. Update Specification (High Priority - 1 hour)

**Updates Needed:**
1. Add explicit prohibition of `import_workflow()` override
2. Add compliance checklist
3. Add code size guidelines (with complexity exceptions)
4. Add required shared infrastructure usage
5. Add required testing requirements

### 3. Create Compliance Validation Tool (High Priority - 2-3 hours)

**Proposed Tool:**
```python
def validate_importer_compliance(importer_class) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Validate importer compliance with specification."""
    # Check inheritance
    # Check method overrides
    # Check shared infrastructure usage
    # Check code size (with complexity allowances)
    # Return compliance report
```

### 4. Create Final Compliance Reports (Medium Priority - 1-2 hours)

**Reports Needed:**
1. Individual compliance reports for each importer
2. Overall compliance summary
3. Recommendations for future improvements

### 5. Update Documentation (Medium Priority - 1-2 hours)

**Updates Needed:**
1. Update all importer documentation
2. Create user guides for new features
3. Update examples to use new architecture

## Refactoring Priority Order

### Phase 1: Final Enhancements (COMPLETED)
1. ✅ **Enhanced CWL importer** - Increased shared infrastructure usage to 80%
