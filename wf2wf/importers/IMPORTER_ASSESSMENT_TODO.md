# Importer Assessment and Refactoring To-Do List

## Overview
This document tracks the assessment and refactoring of all importers in the wf2wf project to use the new shared infrastructure, intelligent inference, and comprehensive loss side-car integration.

## Assessment Criteria for Each Importer

### 1. Code Duplication Analysis
- [ ] How much code could be moved to shared infrastructure
- [ ] Current inheritance from BaseImporter
- [ ] Use of shared workflow pattern
- [ ] Duplication of common parsing patterns

### 2. Loss Side-Car Integration
- [ ] Current support for loss side-car
- [ ] Calls to `detect_and_apply_loss_sidecar()`
- [ ] Loss tracking during export
- [ ] Integration with loss reporting

### 3. Intelligent Inference
- [ ] What missing information could be auto-filled
- [ ] Use of `infer_environment_specific_values()`
- [ ] Use of `infer_execution_model()`
- [ ] Use of inference engine
- [ ] Environment-specific value inference
- [ ] Resource requirement inference

### 4. Interactive Mode
- [ ] What user prompting could be added
- [ ] Use of `prompt_for_missing_information()`
- [ ] Interactive environment adaptation
- [ ] User confirmation for lossy conversions
- [ ] Current interactive prompting support
- [ ] User prompting for missing information
- [ ] Environment adaptation prompting
- [ ] Execution model confirmation

### 5. Environment Management
- [ ] Integration with EnvironmentManager
- [ ] Multi-environment support
- [ ] Environment detection and parsing
- [ ] Container/conda environment handling
- [ ] Environment adaptation for target formats
- [ ] Container and conda environment handling
- [ ] Environment building and management

### 6. Error Handling and Validation
- [ ] Consistent error handling patterns
- [ ] Schema validation integration
- [ ] Graceful degradation
- [ ] User-friendly error messages

### 6. Execution Model Detection
- [ ] Automatic execution model detection
- [ ] Content-based analysis
- [ ] Transition analysis between models
- [ ] Interactive confirmation

## Notes and Observations

### Current Strengths
- Snakemake importer is already well-refactored
- CWL importer has good foundation with some loss side-car support
- BaseImporter infrastructure is solid and comprehensive
- Shared modules (inference, interactive, loss_integration, utils) are well-designed

### Current Weaknesses
- Most importers not using BaseImporter infrastructure
- Inconsistent loss side-car handling across importers
- No intelligent inference in most importers
- No interactive mode in most importers

### Priority Order
1. **Snakemake** - Complete enhancement (already refactored)
2. **DAGMan** - Simple refactor, good test case
3. **Nextflow** - Medium complexity, important format
4. **WDL** - Complex features, important for bioinformatics
5. **Galaxy** - Tool-based workflows, different paradigm

## Last Updated
- **Date**: 2025-01-27
- **Status**: Phase 1 in progress (Snakemake enhancement)
- **Next Action**: Complete Snakemake loss side-car integration
